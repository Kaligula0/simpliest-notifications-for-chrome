Simple button on your toolbar that checks, counts and shows number of all your Facebook notifications in your language.

And it's least memory-consuming of all such extensions available!

Clicking on the button takes you to your facebook homepage (or swithes you to facebook tab, if already opened).

And what's important â€“ you can customize how often it should check for new notifications, completely as you want!
